<h2>Why we care about extensions</h2>

As a digital forensics examiner, our job is to find anything suspicious on a suspects computer (within our warrant of course).
Suspects may attempt to hide files from us by changing the extension of the file so it doesn't look suspicious.  For example,
in child pornography cases, criminals often change the extensions of their obscene images from a .jpg or .png to a .exe or
something else.
